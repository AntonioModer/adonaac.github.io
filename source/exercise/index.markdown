Have you ever gone through a tutorial and then when you're done with it you have no idea what to do next? That's because you didn't actually learn anything.
Just going through the motions of a tutorial and typing whatever the guy tells you to type is **LITERALLY** like playing a game that's 90% made of cutscenes: the actual important part
(interactivity) is put out of focus so people can tell you a nice story. Most tutorials focus on telling you a nice story like "how to use *X* in 10 minutes, oh my god 
it's so easy!" but don't actually teach you anything about *X*.

With that in mind, all tutorials on this site have exercises. Doing exercises is important so that you actually exercise the skill of not knowing what the fuck is going on but
trying to do things anyway, because that's the skill you're gonna need when you're trying to do things on your own. All exercises have answers, but keep in mind that the answers are irrelevant,
they're just there so you can check if your train of thought in solving the exercise was correct.

Isn't there a saying like... give a cat fish and he'll never learn to hunt, give a cat wings and he'll hunt the birds who hunt the fish and be like 2 levels up in the food chain? 
This is exactly what's happening here. So good luck and **do the exercises!!!**
