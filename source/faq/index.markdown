**Should I use fuccboiGDX for my game?**

No. The API is still being heavily changed and also it isn't super amazingly well tested to cover all use cases ever.
If you want to try it out for small games or prototypes it should be fine, but I'd advise against it for more complete games, 
since there are other more mature engines/frameworks out there.

**Examples of games that are being made with fuccboiGDX?**

I'm working on two games that use the engine:

**Why is it called fuccboiGDX?**

First of all I know why you're asking that and let me interject for a moment. You're probably pronouncing
*fuccboi* so that it sounds like "fuck boy", but that is **wrong**. The *u* in *fucc* is supposed to sound like the *u*
in *gucci* or like *foo* in *foobar*, and the *o* in *boi* should be closed, like in *coast* or *koi*. So *fuccboi* should sound like
"foochboi". Having that said, I know that most people will pronounce it like "fuck boy" anyways, which is why I added **GDX** at in the end.
**GDX** is a combination of letters that passes a lot of **professionalism** and so it's used to offset the naturally dirty minds 
of everyone in the world.
