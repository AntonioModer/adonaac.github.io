<h3 id="description" data-magellan-destination="description">Description</h3>

A simple 2D vector class. It's an exact copy of [hump.vector](http://vrld.github.io/hump/#hump.vector), except for the <code class="text">_inplace</code> calls, which have been changed to
<code class="text">normalizeInplace</code> and <code class="text">rotateInplace</code>. Refer to hump.vector's documentation for details on the workings of each method.
