3.  Create a new folder for your project and copy the contents of the fuccboi.zip file to it
4.  [Run](https://www.love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started) the project folder
5.  You should see a black 480x360 screen. If this happens then you're set for starting a new project!

{% title Tutorials %}

Tutorials are so far divided in two sections: advanced and examples. 

<!--
The **beginner** section has a bunch of tutorials for people who have never programmed before and want to get started. 
The topics covered range from the very basics of programming up to right before object orientation is needed. 

The **intermediate** section is for people who already have some programming experience (and for people who went through the beginner tutorials) 
but don't necessarily know Lua, LÖVE nor game programming enough. The topics covered range from a bottom up explanation of object oriented programming 
to making newbie-friendly games such as Pong, Asteroids, Arkanoid, Tetris and so on. 
-->

The **advanced** section is for people who are already experienced game programmers in other engines/frameworks and 
who simply want to learn how to use fuccboiGDX. The tutorials there are games that vary on complexity, but all have 
the main goal of showcasing different uses of the engine as well as recommended best practices. 

The **examples** section simply has a lot of short examples on how to do X or Y. It's supposed to serve as a fast way 
of checking how to do some action without having to look at the full documentation, for people who are more example driven
or who want to get a feel for how coding things with fuccboiGDX works.

**Advanced**

*   [2D Platformer](tutorials/2d-platformer) - simple 2D platformer using box2d physics and the {% text engine %};
*   [Dweomercraft](tutorials/dweomercraft) - The Binding of Isaac clone using the {% text engine %} and all its features;
