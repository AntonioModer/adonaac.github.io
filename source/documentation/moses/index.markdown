{% title Description %}

An utility library with tons of functions that makes operations on tables, arrays, lists, collections and objects
a lot easier than they are with vanilla Lua. It's an exact copy of [Moses](http://github.com/Yonaba/Moses), so refer to this 
[tutorial](https://github.com/Yonaba/Moses/blob/master/doc/tutorial.md) for a list and an explanation of all functions
it implements. It can be accessed through {% text mg.moses %}, {% text mg.mo %} or {% text mg.fn %}.
