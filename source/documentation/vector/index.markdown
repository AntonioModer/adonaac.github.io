{% title Description %}

A simple 2D vector class. It's an exact copy of [hump.vector](http://vrld.github.io/hump/#hump.vector), 
except for the {% text _inplace %} calls, which have been changed to {% text normalizeInplace %} and {% text rotateInplace %}. 
Refer to hump.vector's documentation for details on the workings of each method.
