Most tutorials on this site have requirements. Before reading each tutorial you must have experience with each of the listed subjects. If a tutorial says
you need Object Oriented Programming knowledge and you have no idea what classes are, then you will not have a good time understanding it.

The final idea is that all requirements will be available as tutorials on this site, but while that doesn't happen, please learn about those subjects elsewhere
before venturing further. Mogamett is pretty useful but before it can be used properly it requires quite a bit of programming knowledge as well as experience using LÃ–VE.
